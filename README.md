# Blog - thejsdeveloper

## Getting Started

This is a Next 14 project. You'll first need to install NPM dependencies, and then run a local development server. Here are the relevant terminal commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run a development server:
npm run dev
```

To create new components, you can use this helper script. It saves you a bit of time, creating all the files and adding the standard code:

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```

> **Using a Markdown renderer**
> For best results, you should use a Markdown renderer to view this file. This README includes lots of embedded images and screen recordings, and you'll need a Markdown renderer to be able to view them.
>
> In VS Code, you can render this README by opening the command palette (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows/Linux, `⌘` + `Shift` + `P` on MacOS), typing “Markdown”, and selecting “Markdown: Open Preview”.
